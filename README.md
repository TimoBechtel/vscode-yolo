# YOLO - VSCode Extension

One command to push all your broken code straight to production.

(`saveAll > stageAll > commit > sync`)

## Features

Commits all your ~~crappy~~ _wonderful_ changes with a random commit from http://whatthecommit.com/ and pushes them automatically using a single command.

Also convenient to impress your coworkers with professional looking commit messages.

**Note**: Do this before going on vacation for an even greater effect.

## Usage

1. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + p`
2. Type `YOLO` and press `ENTER`
3. Blame someone else

> Protip: You can also add a keybinding for magically destroying your github repo.

## Configuration

`yolo.pushAfterCommit` : enable/disable push after commit (default: true)
